### GROUPOMANIA

### TORTEVOIS Benoit --- project initiated on 2022/07/02

Technologies used: ReactJS (complete app), HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript

Node.js + Express

SQL database with MySQL

Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile, small mobile)

### DEV mode

Set up:

- Import the database in your DB system from the dump file you downloaded
- Create and edit .env file in /groupomania and /groupomania/back (see .env.example files to edit, use recommended ports to avoid dysfunctions)
- From /groupomania and /groupomania/back, enter npm install in terminal

Start the app:

- From /groupomania/back : enter "nodemon server" in terminal
- From /groupomania : enter "npm run start" terminal

The server should open automatically a window in your internet browser pointing to the right address. If not, run your browser and enter address manually: "http://localhost:4200/" (if you set recommended ports numbers in .env files)
